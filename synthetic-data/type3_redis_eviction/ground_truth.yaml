incident_id: type3_redis_eviction_easy
root_cause: Redis memory full leading to key evictions and cache miss storm
anomaly_source: redis
signal_path:
- redis memory usage grows
- evictions start
- cache hit rate drops
- api latency increases due to db fallbacks
remediation:
- Increase redis memory limit or scale horizontally
- Review TTL settings and eviction policy
- Cache fewer, more critical keys if memory constrained
severity: SEV3
